    Simulated Annealing optimizer for the batch scheduling problem.

    Representation:
      - For each resource, a list (ordering) of tasks assigned to that resource.
      - A greedy batching procedure (in construct_batch_schedule) groups tasks with the same type,
        up to the resourceâ€™s capacity, and assigns start/finish times.
    
    Evaluation:
      - The candidate schedule is built from the ordering and then evaluated using the
        problem's own evaluate_solution method.
    
    Neighborhood Moves:
      - For a randomly chosen resource, either swap two tasks or reinsert a task at a new position.
