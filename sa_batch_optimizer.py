    Simulated Annealing optimizer for the batch scheduling problem.
    
    Representation:
      - For each resource, a list (ordering) of tasks assigned to that resource.
      - A greedy batching procedure groups consecutive tasks (with identical types)
        into batches up to the resource capacity.
    
    Evaluation:
      - For each resource, tasks are scheduled in batches.
      - Batch start time is the maximum of the finish time of the previous batch 
        and the finish times of any predecessors.
      - Batch duration is the maximum duration of tasks in that batch.
      - The objective is the overall makespan plus a large penalty for any precedence violations.
    
    Neighborhood Moves:
      - For a randomly chosen resource, either swap two tasks or reinsert a task at a new position.
